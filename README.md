# GOREGEX

Generating code for static regex

### Limitations

Only generates code to match the input, and does not do capturing yet or matching multiple times in a string

### Examples

See [the test generator](./pkg/test_gen) directory for example of how to use this.
Checkout [the tests](./test) directory for packages that don't and with `_test` to see the generated code.
